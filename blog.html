        Frontend development is one of the critical skills for web developers as there is a lot of demand for
        programmers with excellent front-end development skills.
        If youâ€™ve never experienced client-side web development, learning the plethora of front-end technologies can be
        difficult, but with proper guidance and choosing the right courses, you can achieve your target.
        The one thing which I want to tell you that a good knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a must for any
        front-end developer. Even though we are living in the era of frameworks and libraries, but knowledge of these
        fundamental technologies cannot be undermined.
        <br><br>

        Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what
        you are writing.
        HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
        The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial.
        For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.

          <summary>HTML</summary>
          HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web
          pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification
          which was published in 1995.
          HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely
          used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was
          published in 2012.

          <summary>CSS</summary>
          CSS is the acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet". This tutorial covers both the versions CSS1,CSS2 and CSS3, and
          gives a complete understanding of CSS, starting from its basics to advanced concepts.
          Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the
          process of making web pages presentable.
          CSS is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they
          are working in Web Development Domain.
          <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Create Stunning Web site - CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page.
            Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how
            columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used,
            layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other
            effects.</li>

          <summary>JavaScript</summary>
          JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
          Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page
          behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated
          JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
          It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
          supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
          interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
          Document Object Model (DOM).
